## [3.5.4] — 2026-09-20 — Audit pass: accessibility, correctness, and real gates

A full audit of the React and Vue sources (UI, charts, shapes, canvas effects, motion)
and the fixes for everything it found. No intentional breaking changes.

### Fixed — user-visible bugs

- **Vue charts rendered in ECharts' default colours, not BoldKit's.** The palette and the
  whole `neubrutalismTheme` were `hsl(var(--token))` strings handed to a **canvas**
  renderer, which has no CSS cascade — an unresolvable colour assigned to `fillStyle` is
  silently ignored and the previous value persists. Variables are now resolved against the
  chart's own element (so scoped themes and dark mode work) and re-resolved when the
  document theme changes.
- **`Stepper` could never be completed.** `totalSteps` counted `<StepperItem>` among the
  root's *direct* children, but every documented composition nests them inside
  `<StepperList>` — so `totalSteps` was 0, `isLast` was permanently false, "Next" ran past
  the final step into blank panels and `onComplete` never fired. Counting is now
  depth-first, with an explicit `totalSteps` prop as an override.
- **The documented `Stepper` snippet threw on paste.** `<StepperSeparator>` required an
  item context the docs' own markup doesn't provide. It now renders outside an item.
- **`Tour` fought the user's scroll.** `scrollIntoView` ran inside the capture-phase scroll
  handler, so it re-triggered itself through its own smooth animation and pinned the page
  to the spotlight. Scrolling is now part of the step transition; measurement is
  rAF-coalesced.
- **`Carousel` swallowed Arrow keys** from any `<input>`/`<textarea>` inside a slide — it
  preventDefault'd in the capture phase, so the field never saw the key.
- **Heatmap and Sankey crashed on `undefined` data** — the memos reading `data` ran above
  the empty guard, making its `!data` branch unreachable. That is the shape a still-loading
  fetch passes.
- **`GaugeChart` zone bounds were read as dial percentages, not data units**, so any
  `min`/`max` other than 0/100 painted the wrong bands and picked the wrong colour.
- **`TagInput`'s `delimiter` was compiled as a regex in Vue** — `'.'` split on every
  character, `'('` threw on every keystroke. It now splits on the literal string, as React
  always did.
- **Chart exports were unreadable in dark mode** — a hardcoded white backdrop under
  near-white inlined text. The backdrop now follows the chart's own background.
- **`Slider`** called `setState` from inside another updater (double-fired under
  StrictMode) and produced `NaN` in inline styles when `max === min` or `step === 0`.
- **Shapes ignored `color` when not filled.** `<Shape filled={false} color="red" />` drew a
  black outline with no way to recolour it. `color` now drives the outline for unfilled
  shapes, and a `strokeColor` prop overrides it — across all 110 components.
- **Vue `canvas-effect-core` was stale**, missing the large-canvas clamping fix React got.

### Fixed — accessibility

- The **docs site ignored `prefers-reduced-motion`**: `src/styles/globals.css` was missing
  the universal reset the other two stylesheets ship, so all 18 smooth shape presets and
  the marquee ran at full speed for users who asked for no motion.
- **JS-driven animation now respects reduced motion** — a CSS media query can't stop a loop
  that mutates attributes. The two MathCurve components and all 34 ASCII shapes (React
  factory + 17 Vue SFCs) consult it, react to changes mid-session, and additionally pause
  off-screen and in background tabs. The Vue ASCII shapes were also missing `aria-hidden`.
- **`TreeView`** rebuilt to the ARIA tree pattern in both frameworks: one tab stop instead
  of one per node, Up/Down/Home/End navigation, treeitems actually owned by a `tree`/`group`,
  no interactive controls nested inside a treeitem, and `aria-selected` only where
  selection exists.
- **`Tour`** is now a real modal dialog in both frameworks — role, `aria-modal`, accessible
  name and description, initial focus, a focus trap, Escape to close, and focus restored on
  close. Previously Tab wandered onto the page hidden behind the scrim.
- **`TagInput`** exposes proper combobox/listbox semantics with `aria-activedescendant`, and
  announces validation errors instead of showing them only visually.
- **`Dropzone` was mouse-only in Vue** — focusable but Enter and Space did nothing, and the
  drop target had no name. Its remove buttons now say which file they remove.
- **`ComboboxMultiTrigger`** chips moved out of the trigger button, so removing one is
  keyboard-reachable and named rather than a bare unfocusable `<svg onClick>`.
- **`Stepper`** dropped tab roles it never implemented (no arrow keys, tabs not owned by the
  tablist) for `aria-current="step"`.
- **`Rating`** moves DOM focus with its roving tabindex, and a read-only rating is exposed as
  read-only rather than removed from the accessibility tree.
- **`GaugeChart` is a `meter`** with its value exposed; **sparklines** have a derived
  accessible name; **heatmaps** no longer hide their own labelled cells behind `role="img"`
  or put hundreds of nameless cells in the tab order; **Sankey** ships a visually-hidden
  table alternative to its hover-only tooltip; **every Vue chart** accepts `ariaLabel`.
- **`Marquee`**'s duplicated track is `inert`, and it pauses on keyboard focus, not just hover.

### Fixed — things the registry shipped broken

- `motion.css` declared `--shadow-color: var(--shadow-color, …)`, which is self-referential
  and therefore invalid — every `.bk-press` / `.bk-pulse-shadow` shadow resolved to nothing
  for anyone installing it standalone.
- The `styles` item shipped `globals.css` without `motion.css` in **both** frameworks, so
  consumers got a dangling `animation: bk-stamp-in` and none of the six motion recipes.
- `registry/default/ui/chart.tsx` had drifted: a legend `key` bug src had already fixed,
  and `useChart` / `ChartContext` / `THEMES` / `getPayloadConfigFromPayload` / the tooltip
  and legend prop types unexported. The entire chart **annotations** API shipped nowhere at
  all and is now bundled.

### Fixed — tooling

- **`npm run typecheck` checked zero files.** The root `tsconfig.json` is a solution file
  (`"files": []` plus references), so `tsc --noEmit` against it was a no-op. It now checks
  both projects.
- **ESLint's 1907 warnings were 77% template formatting**, burying the two that mattered.
  Formatting rules are off (that is Prettier's job); output is down to 1.

### Added — guards, so these can't come back

- `stylesheet-parity.test.ts` enforces the five-stylesheet rule that has now shipped broken
  three times: token and rule parity across the three `globals.css`, byte identity of the
  two `motion.css`, every `animation:` resolving to a reachable `@keyframes`, no
  self-referential custom properties, and a reduced-motion reset in each.
- The registry sync script asserts the hand-maintained chart bundle exports a superset of
  the modules it bundles.
- Tests: 677 → 839 (React), 114 → 313 (Vue), covering every fix above plus the first
  coverage for shapes, TreeView, Tour, the pickers and the chart a11y surface.

### Changed

- Vue charts accept React's `emptyState` prop name; `emptyMessage` still works.
- `DatePicker` gained `defaultValue`. It, `TimePicker` and `DateRangePicker` now decide
  controlled-ness from whether the `value` prop is *present*, latched on first render —
  `undefined` is a legal controlled value for an optional date, so the ordinary
  `useState<Date>()` pattern used to start uncontrolled and silently flip on first pick.
- `Rating`, `DatePicker`, `TimePicker`, `DateRangePicker` and `Sidebar` forward refs and
  rest props. `Sidebar`'s mobile branch previously dropped `ref`, `className` and `...props`
  entirely, so the same component honoured different props depending on viewport width.

### Known divergences (not changed — these need a breaking release)

- `variant` means chart *geometry* in React but container *style* in Vue.
- `RadialBarChart` scales to `max(values)` in React and `max(values) * 1.2` in Vue.
- `RadarChart`'s `showLegend` defaults `true` in React, `false` in Vue.
- `height` is a number of pixels in React, a CSS string in Vue.

## [3.5.3] — 2026-08-30 — Green CI: 155 lint errors cleared

CI had been failing since May 2026. Because Lint ran first, every typecheck, test and build step
was skipped — including the Vue CanvasEffects typecheck added in v3.5.2. All 155 errors are now
fixed and the pipeline runs end to end.

Roughly two thirds turned out to be misconfiguration rather than bad code:

### Fixed — configuration

🩹 **54 false positives from the plain-JS `no-unused-vars` rule running on TypeScript `.vue` files.**
It read the parameter names inside type annotations — `PropType<(id: string) => void>`,
`isDateUnavailable?: (date: DateValue) => boolean` — as unused runtime params. Renaming them to
`_id` would have silenced the rule while making the types less readable; the TS-aware rule is used
instead.

🩹 **`vue/multi-word-component-names` (49) disabled for the component library.** `Button.vue`,
`Card.vue` and `Alert.vue` are the public API. The rule guards app components against colliding with
HTML elements, which doesn't apply to a namespaced kit installed via the shadcn CLI.

🩹 **Underscore-prefixed bindings are now honoured** as the existing "deliberately unused" marker.

🩹 **`no-undef` off for `.vue` files** — they're TypeScript, which already reports undefined
identifiers and understands bundler-replaced `process.env.NODE_ENV`. This is why the React
`ErrorBoundary` using the identical expression was never flagged.

🩹 **`.claude/` excluded from linting.** It holds stale git worktrees — whole second copies of the
repo — that contributed 76 duplicate errors locally.

### Fixed — code

🐛 **Cascading renders removed from six components.** `Header`, `CanvasSettings`, `settings-page` and
`Tour` synced state from props inside an effect; they now adjust during render, React's documented
pattern, so no component paints a stale value for a frame first.

🐛 **`useIsMobile` rewritten with `useSyncExternalStore`.** It rendered once with `undefined`, then
set state in an effect — a cascading render and a frame of desktop layout on a phone.

🐛 **`DotMatrixStudio` shape preview no longer reads a ref during render.** It used a ref plus a tick
counter rendered into a hidden `<span>` to force updates; the preview is now state, and the hack is
gone.

🐛 **Latest-ref writes moved out of render** in `AnimationPanel` and `useExport`.

🐛 **`KbdCombo.vue` no longer duplicates Kbd's `cva` block.** Twenty lines of class strings were kept
alive purely to derive a type and were never applied — a silent drift hazard against the styles
`Kbd.vue` actually uses.

### Internals

Three genuine false positives in React's new hooks rules (`react-hooks/refs` on a render-prop call
built from `useState` values, `static-components` on a lucide icon lookup, `set-state-in-effect` on
Embla's imperative init) carry targeted suppressions with reasons rather than contorted code.

---

## [3.5.2] — 2026-08-29 — Canvas lifecycle & 4 new effects

Every CanvasEffect used to hand-roll the same four concerns — size the backing store, start a rAF
loop, observe resize, cancel on teardown. None paused when scrolled out of view, none paused in a
background tab, none capped the pixel count on a 4K display, and none respected
`prefers-reduced-motion`. That was 19 effects × 2 frameworks each burning a core rendering pixels
nobody could see. This release moves all of it into one shared lifecycle, and adds four new effects
on top of it.

### Added

✨ **Four new canvas effects** — React and Vue, inspired by the paper-shaders catalogue:
- **Mesh Gradient** — drifting colour control points blended per pixel, with a `steps` prop that
  posterises the field into hard screen-printed bands
- **Swirl** — colour bands wound into a spiral by radius; razor-sharp by default, `softness` to blend
- **God Rays** — a fan of volumetric light wedges radiating from a configurable source
- **Pulsing Border** — light spots orbit a frame and bleed inward, leaving the centre clear for content

✨ **`useCanvasEffect`** (React hook) and **`useCanvasEffect`** (Vue composable) over a new
framework-agnostic `canvas-effect-core`, mirroring the existing `motion-core` → adapter split. An
effect now describes how to paint one frame; the lifecycle owns everything else.

✨ **`onReducedMotionChange`** in `motion-core` — `prefersReducedMotion()` is a point-in-time read,
which is enough for a one-shot animation but not for a long-lived loop that must stop the moment the
user flips the OS setting.

### Behaviour changes

🩹 **Effects pause when off-screen or backgrounded.** An IntersectionObserver and `visibilitychange`
cancel the rAF outright rather than looping with a no-op frame, so a paused effect costs nothing.

🩹 **Backing stores are capped at ~4M pixels** and sized from `devicePixelContentBoxSize` where
available. A full-bleed canvas on a 4K display was allocating ~8.3M pixels per frame of per-pixel JS.

🩹 **Motion is refresh-rate independent.** Effects advanced time per *frame*, so they ran at double
speed on a 120Hz display. Frame callbacks now receive a normalised delta. Alpha-based trails
(Matrix Rain, Flow Field, Gravity Wells, Warp Speed) compound over that delta so trail length is
unchanged between 60Hz and 120Hz.

🩹 **`prefers-reduced-motion` renders one static frame** instead of animating, and reacts live.

### Fixed

🐛 **`Halftone` pointer listeners were unreachable** in both frameworks — registered after the frame
function returned, so hover interaction never worked.

🐛 **`Truchet` and `Halftone` mis-scaled** their tile size, line width, gap and cursor position; the
device-pixel ratio they multiplied by was never assigned.

🐛 **`Truchet`'s category badge was invisible** on the docs site — `#0a0a0a` text on its `#111111`
accent. Badge text colour is now derived from the accent's relative luminance.

🐛 **`FlowField` had drifted out of parity** between React and Vue.

🐛 **`MouseRipple` drew into a quarter of its canvas** at DPR 2 — it draws in CSS pixels, and the
scale transform is now re-applied by the lifecycle on every resize (assigning `canvas.width` resets it).

### Internals

🔬 **The Vue CanvasEffects had no automated coverage.** They live outside every `tsconfig` and every
vitest project, so they shipped to consumers unchecked — which is how the parity drift above survived.
Added `typecheck:vue-canvas` and a 48-test suite covering all 23 Vue effects, plus a matching 48-test
React suite and 14 lifecycle tests. `bun run test:vue` runs the Vue project.

🔬 **Registry:** `canvas-effect-core` and `use-canvas-effect` ship as their own items in both
registries; all 38 canvas-effect items declare the dependency, so a `shadcn add` of any effect pulls
the lifecycle with it.

## [3.5.1] — 2026-08-11 — Accessibility sweep, live CTAs & audit fixes

A six-pass audit of everything shipped since v3.4.8, across React and Vue. 30+ bugs fixed, two
regression guards added. Every fix is non-breaking except where noted under **Behaviour changes**.

### Accessibility

♿ **Icon-only controls given accessible names — 20 of them.** Templates, blocks and UI components had
interactive controls whose only content was a lucide icon, which lucide marks `aria-hidden`. Screen
readers announced them as bare "button" — including the blog pagination pair, where previous and next
were indistinguishable. Now covered by a CI guard (`npm run audit:icon-labels`).

♿ **Data conveyed only by icons now has text equivalents.** `ComparisonTable` (both frameworks) and
`PricingTemplate` rendered ✓/✗ cells that read as *empty* to assistive tech — the entire payload of a
comparison table. Added `sr-only` labels, plus `scope="col"`/`scope="row"` so cells are announced with
their feature and column.

♿ **Selection state exposed, not just styled.** `aria-pressed` on the accent-colour swatches and theme
buttons, `aria-current="page"` on the dashboard nav. `ProductTemplate`'s colour radios had no accessible
name at all — their `<Label>` contained only an aria-hidden check.

♿ **`Rating` could become keyboard-unreachable.** Roving tabindex matched `Math.ceil(value)`; an
out-of-range value matched no star, so every star fell to `tabIndex={-1}` and the group left the tab
order. Now clamped. React also announced "1 stars"; Vue already singularised.

### Bug fixes

🐛 **`Progress` clamped to 100 regardless of `max`** (React + Vue). `<Progress max={200} value={150} />`
rendered a full bar while reporting `aria-valuenow=100` against `max=200` — visual and AT disagreeing.
Vue was a regression from v3.5.0; it also silently dropped `getValueText`.

🐛 **Vue registry shipped a dangling `@import`.** `public/r/vue/styles.json` carried
`@import './motion.css'` without shipping that file, breaking `shadcn-vue add .../styles.json` on a
clean project. The rules were already inlined, so the import was redundant. The build now strips it and
throws on any relative import with no shipped sibling.

🐛 **Vue `DocsTemplate` called `navigator.clipboard` unguarded** — an unhandled rejection on `http://`
or older browsers, and the button still claimed "COPIED". Now routed through a `copyToClipboard` helper
mirrored from React. React's copy button gained the timer cleanup Vue already had.

🐛 **MCP server misdescribed its own catalog.** `search_components` and `list_components` advertised
blocks and templates; the catalog contains neither, so an agent would confidently report they don't
exist. `get_install_command` also returned a bare `npx shadcn@latest add` with no URLs when nothing
resolved. Both fixed.

🐛 Misc: `ChartLoading` missing from the Vue barrel; `data-bk-transition` was sticky and bled page
transitions into the theme toggle (now scoped per navigation via `startViewTransition(cb, recipe)`);
`use-theme` couldn't heal a root carrying both `light` and `dark`; `ErrorPages.vue`'s countdown ticked
forever after expiry.

### Behaviour changes

⚠️ **`LogoCloudWithStats` no longer truncates.** It hard-capped at 9 logos, dropping the rest with a
`console.warn` that fired in production on every render. It now renders all logos; pass `maxLogos` to
restore a cap.

✨ **Pricing CTAs are live.** `PricingTier` gains `ctaHref` / `onCtaClick` (React) and a `ctaClick` emit
(Vue); `CheckoutSummary` gains `onCheckout` / `checkoutLabel`. Previously these buttons did nothing.
Hrefs go through `safeHref`.

✨ **Settings appearance persists.** `SettingsPage` rendered `<AppearanceSettings />` with no props, so
theme buttons were dead and nothing survived a reload. Now persisted to `localStorage` under
`boldkit-settings-appearance`, same key and shape in both frameworks, guarded against private mode.

### Documentation

📖 **Blocks and templates are documented as copy-paste only.** They are not registry items in either
framework — `shadcn add` cannot install one and the MCP catalog cannot surface one. `CLAUDE.md`
previously claimed otherwise. Making them installable remains open feature work.

### Tooling

✅ React tests 590 → 610, Vue 59 → 66, MCP 12 → 14. New guards: `audit:icon-labels` (fails on any
unnamed icon-only control, with a vetted-exceptions map) and the Vue registry dangling-import check.
`src/lib/motion-core.ts` was never in the sync script's `LIB_FILES`, so its registry mirror could drift
silently — added.

### Bumps

- React: `3.5.0 → 3.5.1`
- Vue: `3.3.0 → 3.3.1`
- `@boldkit/mcp`: `0.1.0 → 0.2.0`
- `boldkit` (CLI): `0.1.4 → 0.1.5`

> Note: v3.5.0 shipped without a CHANGELOG entry; see the
> [v3.5.0 release](https://github.com/ANIBIT14/boldkit/releases/tag/v3.5.0) for its notes.

## [3.4.9] — 2026-07-21 — Multi-step forms, chart annotations, dark-mode audit & 5 blocks

Four independent workstreams, React + Vue parity throughout.

### Features

🧩 **Multi-step form primitives.** A dependency-free form-state layer (`useMultiStepForm` + `<MultiStepForm>`) that composes with the existing Stepper: per-step validation gates forward navigation, `submit()` fires only on the last step. React + Vue registry items + `/components/multi-step-form` docs with a validated 3-step wizard demo. No new dependency.

📊 **Chart annotations — unified API.** One author-facing vocabulary (`referenceLine`, `callout`, `arrow`) mapped to Recharts (`renderChartAnnotations` → `ReferenceLine`/`ReferenceDot`, React) and echarts (`annotationsToEChartsOption` → `markLine`/`graphic`, Vue). Same annotation objects author in both frameworks. Reference lines require a Cartesian chart; callouts/arrows are data-anchored. Demo on the Charts page (Styles tab).

🧱 **5 new blocks (React + Vue).** Pricing/checkout, Bento grid, Changelog/Roadmap, Comparison table (marketing) and Dashboard layout (application) — composed from existing components, with Blocks-page entries, previews, and doc pages.

### Accessibility

🌗 **Dark-mode contrast audit + fixes + report.** New `scripts/audit-contrast.ts` computes WCAG contrast ratios over every semantic token pair in light **and** dark modes (4.5:1 text / 3:1 UI). Fixed 3 failing pairs — `destructive` `60% → 47%` and light `muted-foreground` `46% → 38%` (across all three `globals.css` copies). Results render as a "Dark-mode contrast" section on `/accessibility` (`contrast-report.json`); the audit is wired into the build and gates on failure.

### Tooling & quality

✅ React tests 532 → 550 (multi-step form ×5, chart annotations ×6, contrast audit ×7); Vue tests add multi-step form + annotation mapper suites. `contrast` added to `build`/`build:ci`.

### Bumps

- React: `3.4.8 → 3.4.9`

## [3.4.8] — 2026-07-19 — Platform/DX: MCP server, CLI & WCAG matrix

The v3.7.0 Platform/DX milestone, shipped early: install BoldKit from an AI agent or the terminal, and a published per-component accessibility matrix.

### Features

🤖 **`@boldkit/mcp` — MCP server** (new package, `packages/mcp`). Lets Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client install components by natural-language description — for **both React and Vue**. Five tools: `search_components` (scored keyword search over a build-time catalog of all 114 registry items), `get_component`, `get_install_command`, `install_components` (shells out to `shadcn` / `shadcn-vue` — no reimplemented resolvers), and `list_components`. Framework auto-detected from the target project's package.json. Setup: `claude mcp add boldkit -- npx -y @boldkit/mcp`.

⌨️ **`boldkit` CLI** (new package, `packages/cli`). `npx boldkit add button card`, `npx boldkit search "toast"`, `npx boldkit list` — auto-detects React vs Vue, maps names to hosted registry URLs, delegates the install to the right shadcn CLI. `--react`/`--vue`/`--dry-run` flags. Shares its core with `@boldkit/mcp`.

📊 **Published WCAG AA matrix at `/accessibility`.** Per-component axe-core results generated from the real CI test run (not a hand-maintained table), rendered as a matrix with honest "not yet automated" gaps. Raw data at `/a11y-report.json`. New `/docs/mcp` page documents the MCP server + CLI.

### Fixes

🐛 **Rating had a nested-interactive violation (React + Vue).** The `role="slider"` container (focusable) wrapped focusable star buttons — axe `nested-interactive`. Rating is now a `role="group"` of toggle buttons with a roving tabindex and `aria-pressed` state; the group label announces the current value and arrow keys still work via bubbled keydown. Caught by the new matrix generation.

### Tooling & quality

✅ **a11y coverage 19 → 30 components** (adds kbd, spinner, skeleton, stat-card, toggle, sticker, marquee, tag-input, rating, pagination, label); fixtures extracted to `src/test/a11y-fixtures.tsx` and the suite now emits the a11y report consumed by `/accessibility`.

🏗 **Monorepo:** root package renamed `boldkit-site` (private) so the CLI package owns the `boldkit` npm name; workspaces now `vue` + `mcp` + `cli`; `registry:build` gained a final `build-mcp-catalog` step so the MCP catalog can never go stale. _npm publish of `boldkit` + `@boldkit/mcp` is a separate manual step (scope ownership to verify)._

### Bumps

- React: `3.4.7 → 3.4.8`
- New: `@boldkit/mcp 0.1.0`, `boldkit` (CLI) `0.1.0`

## [3.4.7] — 2026-07-18 — Codebase audit: SSR, a11y, tests & theme presets

A prioritized audit pass — fixing correctness/DX findings and shipping installable theme presets.

### Fixes

🐛 **Vue `useTheme` crashed under SSR (Nuxt).** The provider's `watch(theme, …, { immediate: true })` touched `window.document` during `setup`, which runs on the server — a `ReferenceError` before hydration. Both the provider watcher and the fallback `updateTheme` now bail when `window` is undefined. Ships in the `use-theme` registry item.

🐛 **Slider thumb had no accessible name (React + Vue).** The custom Slider spread `aria-label` onto the wrapper `<div>`, not the `role="slider"` thumb, so screen readers announced an unnamed slider (axe: `aria-input-field-name`). `aria-label` / `aria-labelledby` now forward to the thumb; the Vue thumb also gained `aria-valuetext` for parity. Surfaced by the expanded a11y suite.

### Tooling & quality

✅ **Vue now has automated tests.** Added Vitest + Vue Test Utils to `@boldkit/vue` (previously zero coverage) with a baseline for `useThemeProvider`/`useTheme` (incl. the SSR regression), `useIsMobile`, and `Button`. Wired into CI.

✅ **a11y coverage 7 → 19 components.** Extended the axe suite to Tabs, RadioGroup, Select, Slider, Progress, Textarea, Accordion, Table, Breadcrumb, Avatar, Separator, and ToggleGroup.

✅ **CI now verifies the full delivery pipeline.** New `build:ci` step runs typegen + `vite build` + `registry:build` + SSG (skips the SEO-only prerender), so registry/build breakage can no longer ship green.

🧹 **Repo hygiene.** Removed a stray untracked `package-lock.json` and gitignored non-bun lockfiles (repo is bun-only); deleted two dead, unreferenced scripts (`generate-examples.js`, `migrate-doc-sources.ts`).

### Features

🎨 **Theme presets ship as CSS-vars-only swaps.** The 14 builder presets are now emitted to `public/themes/<slug>.css` (+ `index.json`) at build time from a shared source (`src/config/theme-presets.ts`), with a per-preset download in the Theme Builder. Drop a file into your `globals.css` to reskin. _Note: presets swap primary/secondary/accent over BoldKit's default neutrals — full per-preset neutral palettes are a later design pass._

### Bumps

- React: `3.4.6 → 3.4.7`
- Vue: `3.2.6 → 3.2.7`

## [3.4.6] — 2026-07-14 — Vue components all build on Nuxt

Installing and building the **entire** Vue library in a real Nuxt 4 project surfaced latent SFC compile errors — components BoldKit's own app never compiled (unused ones are tree-shaken, and `vue-tsc` doesn't enforce these compiler-only rules).

### Fixes

🐛 **`<script setup>` cannot contain ES module exports.** Eight components declared an injection-key `export const … = Symbol()` inside `<script setup>`, which fails the consumer's build: **Carousel, Dropzone, ChartContainer, ToggleGroup, Timeline, SidebarProvider, Stepper, StepperItem**. Each injection key (and any cross-imported context type) now lives in a paired `<script>` block.

🐛 **`GaugeChart` — `defineProps()` cannot reference a local variable.** `withDefaults` referenced a setup-local `DEFAULT_ZONES`, which gets hoisted out of `setup()`. Moved `DEFAULT_ZONES` + `GaugeChartZone` to module scope.

Verified end-to-end: all **364** components compile in a single Nuxt 4 build, `vue-tsc` clean.

### Bumps

- React: `3.4.5 → 3.4.6`
- Vue: `3.2.5 → 3.2.6`

## [3.4.5] — 2026-07-13 — Nuxt compatibility, motion a11y & SEO prerender

Makes BoldKit install cleanly on **Nuxt 4** (verified end-to-end in a real project), plus an animation-audit pass and a docs-site SEO upgrade.

### Fixes

🐛 **Nuxt / srcDir component resolution (#10).** The Vue registry pinned every file to a hardcoded `components/ui/…` target, which shadcn-vue resolves relative to the project root — so on Nuxt 4 (where `@/` → `app/`) files installed to `./components/ui` while imports pointed at `./app/components/ui`. Files now ship without hardcoded targets and place under whatever your aliases resolve to.

🐛 **Alias-relative registry paths (#10).** `@boldkit/utils` (and other lib/composable items) mis-installed to `app/lib/default/lib/utils.ts` when added alongside a component, because the `registry/default/` path prefix collapsed the CLI's common-root computation. Paths are now alias-relative (`components/ui/…`, `lib/…`, `composables/…`), matching upstream shadcn-vue. Verified live on Nuxt 4.

🐛 **Docs showed a barrel import that doesn't exist (#10).** Every Vue usage example used `import { Button } from '@/components/ui'`, but the registry ships individual `.vue` files with no barrel — so consumers copying the docs hit "cannot find module". All 66 pages now show per-file default imports.

🩹 **Vue `ui` barrel synced with disk** (internal); **Nuxt `componentDir` docs** added for auto-import.

### Motion (React + Vue)

♿ **Universal `prefers-reduced-motion` guard** added to the shipped theme — hand-rolled `transition-all` hover effects now honor reduced-motion.
⚡ **`transition-all` → scoped `transition`** everywhere (verified zero visual change).
🎯 **Overlays scale from their trigger**, not center (Radix/Reka transform-origin vars).
⌨️ **Command palette fades** instead of zooming (high-frequency ⌘K).

### Docs site

🚀 **Route prerendering** — every docs route now ships fully-rendered HTML for crawlers and JS-less AI crawlers, instead of an empty `#root`.

## [3.4.4] — 2026-07-06 — Chart export fidelity & fullscreen fixes

Patch fixes for the `<ChartToolbar>` shipped in 3.4.3, across React and Vue.

### Fixes

🐛 **PNG / SVG export now downloads the chart, not a toolbar icon.** The export grabbed the container's first `<svg>` — which was a toolbar *button icon*, not the chart — so downloads came out as a tiny glyph. It now skips the toolbar controls and serializes the actual chart.

🐛 **Exports keep their colors in every viewer.** A chart's colors come from CSS variables (`hsl(var(--primary))`) and external stylesheets, neither of which survive serialization. The export now resolves each element's *computed* style to concrete colors and writes them as presentation **attributes** (not just inline style) plus an opaque white backdrop — so Preview, Quick Look, Illustrator, and browsers all render the real chart, not a colorless outline.

🐛 **Fullscreen no longer leaves a black gap.** A fullscreened chart kept its fixed height, letting the browser's black backdrop show through below it. The container now takes the page background and lays the chart out with a definite height (`flex: 1`), so Recharts' `ResponsiveContainer` and ECharts' `autoresize` grow to fill — no black bars.

🩹 **Crisper canvas exports.** ECharts (canvas) PNGs are composited onto white so a transparent chart background doesn't export as black.

## [3.4.3] — 2026-07-06 — Vue Motion parity, chart export toolbar & CI

A parity-and-foundation release. The headline: the **Vue `<Motion>` adapter** promised in 3.4.2 now ships, closing the last framework gap in the motion system. Alongside it, a new **chart export toolbar** for both frameworks, real **CI**, automated **accessibility** tests, and repo cleanup.

### Highlights

✨ **Vue Motion adapter — parity with React.** `<Motion>`, `<Reveal>`, and `<Stagger>` components plus `useShake` / `useViewTransition` composables now ship for Vue, wrapping the same framework-agnostic `motion-core`. New Vue registry items `motion` + `motion-core` mirror the React `motion-core` / `motion-react` split. The full six-recipe motion language is now identical across React and Vue.

✨ **Chart export toolbar (React + Vue).** New `<ChartToolbar>` wraps any chart with a brutalist overlay to export **PNG**, **SVG**, or **CSV**, and toggle **fullscreen**. Engine-agnostic — it reads the wrapped `<svg>` (Recharts) or `<canvas>` (ECharts), so one shared `chart-export` core drives both frameworks. Registry items: `chart-export` + `chart-toolbar`.

♿ **Automated accessibility.** `axe-core` now runs in the test suite over core components (Button, Input, Label, Badge, Alert, Card, Checkbox, Switch), so a11y regressions fail CI instead of waiting for a manual audit.

🩹 **Continuous integration.** A real CI pipeline (lint + React `tsc` + Vue `vue-tsc` + tests + registry audit) replaces the old React-Native-only workflow.

🧹 **Removed the phantom `react-native` package.** It carried no source — only an Expo example and committed build cache — and is now deleted. `.gitignore` hardened against Expo/Android/iOS build artifacts.

### Docs

- New live docs at **`/components/chart-toolbar`** (React demo + Vue snippets).
- Vue `<Motion>` examples on **`/components/motion`** are now backed by a real, installable adapter.

### Notes

- No breaking changes. All existing React and Vue components are untouched.
- Vue Motion installs via `npx shadcn-vue@latest add @boldkit/motion` (pulls `motion-core` transitively).

## [3.4.2] — 2026-06-18 — Motion system + buttery component retrofit

The signature **"hard look, buttery feel"** release. Neubrutalism's reputation is harsh and static — this patch keeps the hard visual language (3px borders, 4px offset shadows, sharp corners) but gives every interaction a premium, settled motion so the kit *feels* world-class to use.

### Highlights

✨ **Motion system (React).** New `motion`, `motion-core`, and `motion-react` registry items. A framework-agnostic, zero-runtime CSS core (`--bk-*` tokens, canonical keyframes, a reduced-motion guard) drives six signature recipes — `press`, `stamp-in`, `shake`, `reveal`, `slide-hard`, `pulse-shadow` — exposed through `<Motion>`, `<Reveal>`, `<Stagger>` components plus `useShake` / `useViewTransition` hooks. SSR-safe. Live docs at `/components/motion`.

✨ **Buttery retrofit, by default (React + Vue).** Button, Card, Input, Toggle, and Switch now route their press/hover/focus through a shared `.bk-interactive` timing on a new **snap** easing curve — the chunky shadow-collapse *settles* with a small overshoot instead of a flat slide. Easing is split: overshoot applies only to `transform`/`box-shadow`, while colour/border/opacity stay on a smooth `ease-out` (no hover flicker).

🩹 **`.bk-press` press choreography.** Animates `transform` + a hard offset `box-shadow` (composes correctly with a background colour), replacing an earlier pseudo-element approach that could invert under the hover transform.

♿ **Reduced-motion throughout.** Every recipe and the `.bk-interactive` timing collapse to near-instant under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`; reveals show their content immediately.

### Notes

- The Vue **`<Motion>`/`<Reveal>` adapter** is not in this release — the buttery **retrofit** ships for Vue now; the Vue adapter components follow in a focused update.

### Bumps

- React: `3.4.1 → 3.4.2`
- Vue: `3.2.1 → 3.2.2`

## [3.4.1] — 2026-06-10 — Custom easing system + docs Theming fix

A motion-polish + docs fix patch. Every transition and animation in BoldKit now runs on a **custom easing system** based on the [animations.dev](https://animations.dev/learn/animation-theory/the-easing-blueprint) easing blueprint — the browser's built-in `ease-out` / `ease-in-out` curves are too weak to read as "snappy" on hard neubrutalist surfaces, so they're replaced with stronger custom `cubic-bezier` curves. Applied identically across **React and Vue 3**.

### Highlights

✨ **Custom easing tokens.** New `--ease-out` (out-quart), `--ease-in-out` (in-out-cubic), and `--ease-in` design tokens in `@theme`, plus a named scale (`--ease-out-quad…expo`, `--ease-in-out-quad…quint`) sorted weakest→strongest. `--default-transition-timing-function` is now `ease-out`, so every `transition-*` utility gets responsive motion for free.

✨ **Every animation retrofitted.** ~37 keyframe animations per stylesheet (accordion, collapsible, bounce, pop, shake, wiggle, jello, etc.) now reference the easing tokens. Continuous `linear` motion (marquee, spin) and the caret blink are intentionally left untouched.

🩹 **Overlays animate with intent.** All 16 React + 18 Vue overlay components (Popover, Dialog, Dropdown, Tooltip, Sheet, Select, Menubar, Context Menu, Hover Card, Command, Tour, …) now apply the custom `ease-out` curve on enter/exit instead of falling back to the browser default.

🐛 **Docs "Theming" opens the full Theme Builder.** The Theming entry in the docs sidebar was rendering the Theme Builder embedded in the narrow docs column, where it didn't lay out fully. It now opens the standalone full-width `/themes` page in a new tab.

## [3.4.0] — 2026-06-08 — 9 new components + Vue parity

Closes the longest-standing gap against the shadcn component set: BoldKit now ships every classic Radix/Reka primitive. **Nine new components**, each with full React **and** Vue 3 parity, installable via the registry. Plus a manifest-driven docs refactor and a batch of UI fixes surfaced while building them.

### Highlights

✨ **Four classic primitives, finally.** **Context Menu** (right-click menus), **Menubar** (desktop-style app toolbars), **Navigation Menu** (site nav with dropdown panels), and **Resizable** (draggable split panes / dashboard layouts) — neubrutalized over Radix (React) and Reka UI (Vue). These were the only standard shadcn components BoldKit didn't have.

✨ **Five form/layout adds.** **Button Group**, **Input Group** (inputs with leading/trailing addons), **Field** (label + control + description + error composition), **Native Select** (a11y-first styled `<select>`), and a single **Date Picker** (button → calendar popover) to complement the existing Date Range Picker.

✨ **Full Vue 3 parity for all nine.** Every new component ships matching Reka UI implementations and `r/vue/*.json` registry entries — no "coming soon" placeholders.

🐛 **Resizable vertical panels no longer collapse.** `react-resizable-panels` sets an inline `height:100%` that overrides a `h-*` class; demos and docs now use `min-h-*` (the documented pattern) so vertical groups size correctly. The npm dep is pinned to `react-resizable-panels@^2.1.0` so consumers get the matching API.

🐛 **Navigation Menu dropdown renders reliably.** Reworked to render its panel in place (the Radix viewport's measured-height mechanism was collapsing the panel to zero).

🩹 **Date Range Picker presets restyled** as proper neubrutalist buttons (hard border + shadow + press), and the single **Date Picker** now correctly tracks a controlled `value`.

### Internals

- **Docs routes are now manifest-driven.** `src/config/component-docs.tsx` is the single source for every component/block doc route; `App.tsx` maps over it (shrank from 336 → ~165 lines). Adding a component is a one-line entry.
- New components are registered in the command palette (⌘K) search and the sitemap + `llms-full.txt`.
- `ComponentDoc` gained an opt-in `previewClassName` (used to give the Navigation Menu preview headroom for its open dropdown).

## [3.3.9] — 2026-05-29 — Next.js + Tailwind v4 compatibility

Three install-time bugs reported against v3.3.8 — all in the path between BoldKit's docs/registry and a fresh Next.js + Tailwind v4 + shadcn project. None affect existing Vite users.

### Highlights

🩹 **`import.meta.env.DEV` no longer breaks Next.js builds** (#8). Five components emitted Vite-only `import.meta.env.DEV` reads — fine under Vite, fatal under `next build` because Next.js does not type `ImportMeta.env`. Replaced with `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` everywhere (works in both Vite and Next): React `ErrorBoundary`, `Tour`, `Slider`, `SankeyChart`, `Invoice` block, and the Vue `ErrorBoundary` (hoisted to an `isDev` const so the template binding stays SSR-safe). Registry JSONs regenerated.

🩹 **Theme Builder now emits a Tailwind v4 `@theme` bridge** (#7). The generator at `/theme-builder` shipped only `:root { --background: 60 9% 98%; }` etc. — raw HSL channels with no `--color-*` mapping. Pasted into a Tailwind v4 + shadcn project that expects `--color-background: var(--background)`, the utilities resolved to `background-color: 60 9% 98%` (invalid). Generator now prepends a full `@theme { --color-background: hsl(var(--background)); … }` block matching the shipped registry styles, plus the `--radius-sm/md/lg/xl` shorthands. Every preset funnels through `generateCSS()`, so all themes inherit the fix.

🩹 **Registry alias docs use the `{name}.json` template** (#9). shadcn 4.x requires the templated item URL in the `registries` map — BoldKit's install docs showed `"@boldkit": "https://boldkit.dev/r"` (and Vue `…/r/vue`), which fails to resolve `@boldkit/button`. Updated Installation page, Introduction page (both copy-buttons), and README to:
- React: `https://boldkit.dev/r/{name}.json`
- Vue: `https://boldkit.dev/r/vue/{name}.json`

### Internals

- `tsconfig.app.json` now includes `"node"` in `types` and adds `@types/node` to devDeps — required so the new `process.env.NODE_ENV` reads type-check under BoldKit's own `tsc -b`. Downstream Next.js users already have these via Next.

## [3.3.8] — 2026-05-29 — Registry recheck + chart family fix

A follow-up stability pass after a full source-vs-registry recheck. **36 install-breakers** that were silently shipping in v3.3.7 — caught by extending the audit script to cover relative imports, fixed in this release.

### Highlights

🩹 **React chart family is installable.** All 9 standalone chart entries (`donut-chart`, `radar-chart`, `radial-bar-chart`, `gauge-chart`, `sparkline`, `funnel-chart`, `treemap-chart`, `heatmap-chart`, `sankey-chart`) shipped with install targets at `components/ui/chart/<name>.tsx` while their relative `./chart` import resolved to a path nothing shipped. Flattened all chart targets to `components/ui/<name>.tsx` so `./chart` correctly hits the base `chart` entry. Added missing `@boldkit/chart` registryDep to the four entries that import `./empty`.

🩹 **8 Vue entries had missing `registryDependencies` or stale file lists.** `alert-dialog`, `calendar`, `pagination` now declare `button` (each imports `./button-variants`). `toggle-group` declares `toggle`. `dropzone` declares `progress` + `spinner`. `stat-card` declares `card` + `progress`. `empty-state` and `layered-card` now ship their `-variants.ts` sibling. `pagination` and `dropdown-menu` had stale `files:` lists referencing components that don't exist on disk — corrected.

🩹 **20 Vue shapes were missing from the registry.** `SHAPE_FILES` had drifted 20 entries behind the 55 on disk. Replaced with disk auto-discovery so any new shape ships automatically: Apple, Crescent, Decagon, Ellipse, FibonacciSpiral, Gear, Heptagon, KochSnowflake, MobiusStrip, PenroseTriangle, Planet, Rainbow, Rhombus, Seal, Star6, Sun, Torus, Trefoil, Umbrella, WavyRectangle.

✨ **Vue parity for `ascii-shapes` and `error-boundary`.** Both existed on the React side but had no Vue install path. ASCII Shapes now ship all 17 components + constants via a new subdirectory codepath. ErrorBoundary now has a Vue equivalent using `onErrorCaptured` with the same neubrutalism fallback UI; published as `r/vue/error-boundary.json`.

✨ **New `/components/error-boundary` docs page.** Framework-switched preview/code/install with a live "Trigger error" demo button. Sidebar entry + Installation page entry added.

🐛 **Blocks page no longer shows broken install commands.** All 15 block cards were displaying `npx shadcn add boldkit.dev/r/<block>.json` commands that 404'd — the block registry entries don't exist (blocks remain copy/paste-grade). Removed the install bar UI. Each block doc page now has React + Vue "View on GitHub" source links via a new `sourcePaths` prop on `BlockDoc`.

### Internals — new permanent guard

`scripts/audit-registry-imports.mjs` was previously blind to relative imports — only checked `from '@/...'` aliases. Extended to resolve `from './x'` and `from '../x'` against each file's install target, verifying the resolved path is shipped by the same entry or by a declared registryDependency. That single change exposed all 36 issues above in one audit run.

### Bumps

- `package.json`: 3.3.7 → 3.3.8
- `packages/vue/package.json`: 3.1.7 → 3.1.8
- README badge: 3.3.7 → 3.3.8

---

## [3.3.7] — 2026-05-26 — Registry health pass

A focused stability release that fixes install-time failures consumers have been hitting and adds permanent guards so the same classes of bug can't silently return.

### Highlights

🩹 **`@boldkit/*` install path now works end-to-end.** Cross-component deps (`button`, `utils`, `math-curves`, etc.) were resolving against shadcn's default registry instead of BoldKit's. All 74 references across React + Vue are now properly scoped.

🩹 **Vue `math-curve-*` family is installable.** `MathCurveLoader`, `MathCurveProgress`, `MathCurveBackground`, and the shared `math-curves` engine were missing from `shadcn-vue` entirely. Now registered.

🩹 **Chart components ship current source.** React chart-X files synced from `src/components/ui/chart/` with import rewriting. Vue chart entries now bundle `ChartEmpty.vue` and `chart-types.ts` so installs compile.

🩹 **37 UI mirrors caught up with `src/`.** Months of bug fixes (focus-visible, ARIA attrs, edge cases) and security helpers (`safeHref`, `sanitizeCssValue`) had never reached the registry. `rating.tsx` registry was an entirely different implementation from src.

✨ **Two new `MathCurveLoader` curves.** `spiral` and `heart`, both already in the runtime — TypeScript just needed widening.

🐛 **`/components/sidebar` no longer crashes.** Active-state demo was missing its `<SidebarProvider>` wrapper.

### ⚠️ Required setup (positive break)

Add the `@boldkit` alias to your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@boldkit": "https://boldkit.dev/r"
  }
}
```

(Vue: `https://boldkit.dev/r/vue`.)

Then install components as:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @boldkit/button @boldkit/card
# or for Vue
npx shadcn-vue@latest add @boldkit/button @boldkit/card
```

Single-file installs of leaf items (`utils`, `styles`) still work via direct URL, but **any component with cross-deps requires the alias.**

### Internals — drift can't recur

New `scripts/sync-registry-from-src.js` runs as a pre-step in `registry:build`. It copies `src/components/ui/*.tsx` and selected libs into `registry/default/` and self-verifies — if any in-scope mirror still drifts after sync, the build fails. This protects against the silent-drift class of bug going forward.

### Commits

- `2f68fd1` registry: scope cross-references with `@boldkit/` namespace
- `86397c2` registry+docs: finish scoping pass, fix build order, update install docs
- `9b70d71` registry: migrate 6 hand-written Vue entries into build script

## [3.3.0] — 2026-05-05

### ✨ New Components

**Combobox (React + Vue)**
- New `Combobox` component built by composing `Popover` and `Command` — searchable, filterable dropdown with neubrutalism styling
- `ComboboxTrigger` — single-select trigger with thick border, hard shadow, and press-down focus effect
- `ComboboxMultiTrigger` — multi-select trigger with removable tag chips; `values` prop accepts `{ value, label }[]` and `onRemove` (React) / `@remove` (Vue) returns the item's `value` directly (no reverse-lookup needed)
- `ComboboxContent` — popover wrapper with `align="start"` default so the dropdown left-aligns with the trigger
- Re-exports all `Command*` sub-components as `Combobox*` aliases (`ComboboxInput`, `ComboboxList`, `ComboboxEmpty`, `ComboboxGroup`, `ComboboxItem`, `ComboboxSeparator`)
- Installable via shadcn CLI: `npx shadcn@latest add "https://boldkit.dev/r/combobox.json"` (React) / `npx shadcn-vue@latest add "https://boldkit.dev/r/vue/combobox.json"` (Vue)
- Full documentation page at `/components/combobox` with 5 examples: Basic, Multi Select, With Groups, With Label, Disabled
- Added to sidebar navigation, Cmd+K search, and sitemap

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Vue Templates**
- `DocsTemplate.vue` — Added `aria-live="polite"` region so screen readers announce "Copied to clipboard" when copy button is clicked

---

## [3.2.3] — 2026-05-02

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**React Core UI**
- `badge.tsx` — Renders as inline `<span>` instead of block `<div>` (fixes layout in inline contexts)
- `input-otp.tsx` — Added bounds check on `slots[index]` in `InputOTPSlot` — no longer crashes when index is out of range or used outside `OTPInput` context
- `stepper.tsx` — `StepperContent` now has `aria-labelledby` pointing to its corresponding `StepperTrigger` (ARIA tab panel pattern)
- `stepper.tsx` — `StepperTrigger` gets a stable `id` for the labelledby association
- `tree-view.tsx` — Renamed internal `TreeNode` function component to `TreeNodeItem` to eliminate confusion with the exported `TreeNode` interface

**Charts**
- `chart/legend.tsx` — React keys in `ChartLegendContent` now use `dataKey ?? value ?? index` — prevents duplicate key warnings when two series share a label
- `chart/donut-chart.tsx` — `foreignObject` center label now sizes proportionally to `innerRadius` instead of hardcoded `100×60`
- `chart/radial-bar-chart.tsx` — `stacked` variant is now functional — uses `stackId="stack"` on `<RadialBar>` so bars stack angularly in the same track
- `chart/sankey-chart.tsx` — Removed unused `totalVal` variable and `void totalVal` suppressor (dead code)
- `chart/treemap-chart.tsx` — Fixed `Tooltip` `formatter` type annotation to match Recharts' actual `ValueType`
- `math-curve-background.tsx` — Removed `strokeOpacity={0.15}` from the inner `<path>` — was multiplying with the SVG-level `opacity` prop making curves nearly invisible (0.15 × 0.15 = 0.022)
- `math-curve-progress.tsx` — Progress head rotation now uses CSS `style.transform` + `transformBox: fill-box` instead of SVG `transform` attribute — CSS transitions now actually animate

**Shapes**
- `shapes.tsx` — Clamped inner `strokeWidth` to `Math.max(1, strokeWidth - 2)` — no more zero/negative stroke values
- `shapes.tsx` — Added `aria-hidden="true"` to all 55 SVG shape components (decorative SVGs no longer announced by screen readers)
- `ascii-shapes.tsx` — Fixed `drawTorus` B-rotation z-component: `oz2` was incorrectly set to `oz1`, skipping the B-axis rotation and producing a flat torus
- `ascii-shapes.tsx` — Added `aria-hidden="true"` to ASCII art `<pre>` elements

**Blocks**
- `marquee.tsx` — `speed` prop now respected when `direction="right"` (added `animate-marquee-slow-reverse` and `animate-marquee-fast-reverse` CSS classes)
- `team-section.tsx` — Replaced deprecated `Twitter` icon with `XIcon` from lucide-react
- `team-section.tsx` — Hidden social link overlay now has `aria-hidden="true"` and links have `tabIndex={-1}` — keyboard users no longer tab through invisible links
- `footer-section.tsx` — `<Separator>` components standardised to `h-[3px]` (was `h-[2px]`, inconsistent with neubrutalism 3px border standard)
- `contact-section.tsx` — Map container no longer collapses to zero height at `lg` breakpoint (`lg:h-auto` → `lg:h-full lg:min-h-[400px]`)

**Vue (@boldkit/vue v3.1.3)**
- `Tabs.vue` — `update:modelValue` emit narrowed from `string | number` to `string`
- `Select.vue` — Removed `bigint` and `Record<string, unknown>` from `update:modelValue` emit (narrowed to `string | number | null`)
- `DropdownMenuRadioGroup.vue` — Aligned prop (`modelValue?: string | null`) with emit (`string | null`)
- `Tour.vue` — `popoverRef` explicitly typed as `Ref<HTMLDivElement | undefined>`; `totalSteps` in provided context is now a reactive `ComputedRef<number>` instead of a plain number
- `Slider.vue` — Fixed `if (animationId)` falsy check in `onUnmounted` — now uses strict `!== null` so RAF ID `0` is correctly cancelled
- `Dropzone.vue` — `maxFiles` prop is now enforced in `processFiles` — excess files are rejected with `code: 'too-many-files'` instead of silently accepted

---

## [3.2.2] — 2026-04-28

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Canvas Effects — React & Vue (all 10 components)**
- Added `devicePixelRatio` scaling to all `resize()` functions — canvas effects are now sharp on Retina/HiDPI displays instead of blurry
- Initialized `let raf = 0` (was uninitialized `let raf: number`) across all React canvas components
- Added zero-size canvas guard to `Metaballs`, `ParticleWeb`, and `FlowField` (React + Vue) — particles no longer initialize at `(0,0)` when canvas is hidden or in a lazy container
- Fixed `React.CSSProperties` used without `React` namespace import in all 10 React canvas files — now uses `import type { CSSProperties }`
- `MatrixRain` (React + Vue) — added `background: #000` to canvas element so trail fade works on any parent background
- `MouseRipple` (React + Vue) — clamped `size = Math.max(0, 3 + ripple * 9)` to prevent negative values in `fillRect`
- `MouseRipple.vue` — replaced `_cleanup` monkey-patch on DOM node with a proper closure variable; eliminates potential `mousemove` listener leak on unmount
- `Plasma.vue` — added `palette.length < 2` guard in `colorAt()` to prevent `TypeError` crash with single-color palettes
- `Plasma.vue` — added zero-size dimension guard to `resize()` (matching React version)
- `Aurora.tsx` — reset `ctx.shadowColor = 'transparent'` after aurora bands loop to prevent shadow bleed on subsequent draw calls
- Fixed stale registry content in `public/r/plasma.json` and `public/r/vue/plasma.json` — now in sync with current source including DPR scaling and zero-size guards

**Website & UI**
- `Home.tsx` — fixed broken `<Link to="/theme-builder">` (route doesn't exist); corrected to `/themes`
- `Home.tsx` — wrapped `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` in try/catch to handle non-HTTPS / unsupported browsers
- `Home.tsx` — fixed `React.CSSProperties` without `React` import
- `Home.tsx` — `DotMatrixPreview` interval now skips updates when tab is hidden
- `Home.tsx` — copy button `setTimeout` stored in ref and cleared on re-click to avoid stale state updates
- `Header.tsx` — mobile menu (`role="dialog"`) now closes on `Escape` key press
- `Header.tsx` — added keyboard focus trap to mobile menu (ARIA dialog pattern)
- `Header.tsx` — fixed `React.CSSProperties` without `React` import
- `App.tsx` — unknown `/docs/*` paths now redirect to `/docs` instead of silently rendering Introduction
- `App.tsx` — moved `<Toaster />` inside `<BrowserRouter>` for correct provider nesting
- `Footer.tsx` — fixed stat card right-border logic at 2-column mobile breakpoint (was creating dangling border on 3rd item)
- `CanvasEffects.tsx` — hero install/import copy buttons now use the actual `installLine`/`importLine` values instead of hardcoded Aurora strings
- `CanvasEffects.tsx` — "08 More Effects" divider count is now dynamic (`GRID.length`)
- `CanvasEffects.tsx` — Aurora `reactCode`/`vueCode` now includes all 5 colors (was missing `#00dceb`)
- `CanvasEffects.tsx` — each effect card now has `id={effect.id}` for hash-based deep linking
- `SearchCommand.tsx` — canvas effects now navigate to hash anchors (e.g. `/canvas-effects#aurora`) instead of all linking to the same `/canvas-effects` URL
- `SearchCommand.tsx` — `<kbd>` shortcut hint now has `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent screen reader double-announcement

**Build**
- `scripts/build-registry.js` — now processes `public/r/vue/` subdirectory and outputs stripped registry files to `public/vue/` (was silently skipping all Vue registry files)

## [3.1.1] — 2026-04-18

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Core UI Components**
- `skeleton.tsx` — Added missing `React` import (was using `React.HTMLAttributes` without import)
- `sonner.tsx` — Fixed `useTheme` import to use `next-themes` instead of non-existent `@/hooks/use-theme`

## [3.1.0] — 2026-04-16

### ✨ ASCII Shapes — 12 animated ASCII art components

The headline feature of 3.1.0. A complete ASCII animation engine built from scratch — no canvas, no WebGL, just text characters rendered with real 3D math.

**5 three-dimensional shapes** rendered using perspective projection, z-buffering, and Lambertian shading:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `AsciiTorus` | Rotating torus — X+Y axes, tube R1=1.0, ring R2=2.2 |
| `AsciiDonut` | Classic [donut.c](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) — X+Z axes, fatter tube R1=1.2 |
| `AsciiSphere` | Globe with rotating lat/lon grid texture and dark side |
| `AsciiCube` | Solid cube with back-face culling and per-face shading |
| `AsciiHelix` | DNA double helix — two parametric strands with connecting rungs |

**7 generative 2D animations** drawn directly into a character grid each frame:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `AsciiSpiral` | Archimedean spiral arms rotating continuously |
| `AsciiRose` | Rose curve r=cos(5θ) blooming and phase-shifting |
| `AsciiWave` | Multi-frequency sine interference scrolling left→right |
| `AsciiVortex` | Rotating density field collapsing toward center |
| `AsciiPulse` | Concentric rings expanding outward and fading |
| `AsciiMatrix` | Characters raining downward per column |
| `AsciiGrid` | Grid intersections pulsing with traveling waves |

**Shared prop API** (all 12 components):

```tsx
<AsciiTorus
  size="md"          // 'sm' (24×12) | 'md' (48×24) | 'lg' (72×36) | 'hero' (120×60)
  charset="blocks"   // 'blocks' | 'braille' | 'classic' | 'line' | 'dots'
  speed="normal"     // 'slow' (0.4×) | 'normal' (1×) | 'fast' (2.2×)
  color="#e74c3c"    // any CSS color; ignored when multicolor=true
  multicolor         // cycles primary→secondary→accent→warning→info→success per row
  animated={false}   // static first frame — no RAF, fully SSR-safe
/>
```

**Framework support:**
- React — full animated + static
- Vue 3 — full animated + static (`isMounted` guard prevents SSR RAF calls)
- Nuxt — `animated={false}` works without `<ClientOnly>`; animated variants need `<ClientOnly>` to avoid hydration mismatch

**Install:**
```bash
# React
npx shadcn@latest add "https://boldkit.dev/r/ascii-shapes.json"

# Vue 3 / Nuxt
npx shadcn-vue@latest add "https://boldkit.dev/r/vue/ascii-shapes.json"
```

**New pages:**
- `/ascii-shapes` — interactive showcase with live controls (charset, size, color picker, multicolor toggle)
- `/components/ascii-shapes` — full docs with 8 example sections, React + Vue code tabs, props table
