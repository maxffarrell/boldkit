        <p>
          Plenty of organisations end up here without deciding to: a React product app, a Nuxt
          marketing site, an acquired Vue dashboard. Each gets its own component layer, and within a
          year the button in one is 3px different from the button in the other and nobody knows which
          is correct.
        </p>
        <p>The usual escapes, and what each actually costs:</p>
        <DataGrid
          headers={['Approach', 'How it works', 'The cost']}
          rows={[
            ['CSS-only library', 'Ship classes, no component code (daisyUI)', 'No behaviour — you rebuild dropdowns, dialogs and focus traps per framework'],
            ['Web components', 'One implementation, custom elements', 'Awkward framework ergonomics, SSR friction, form participation issues'],
            ['Wrapper packages', 'A package per framework (Flowbite)', 'Two codebases to keep in sync; one usually lags'],
            ['Design tokens only', 'Share variables, build components twice', 'Cheapest to start, but behaviour and a11y still diverge'],
            ['Parallel registries', 'Framework-native source, shared styles', 'Two implementations — but generated and audited together'],
          ]}
        />
        <p>
          There is no free option. The question is which cost you would rather carry, and for most
          teams the answer is &ldquo;anything except rebuilding a focus trap twice&rdquo;.

          BoldKit takes the last row: a real React implementation and a real Vue implementation, with
          everything that <em>can</em> be shared being shared.
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-1 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Stylesheets are shared verbatim.</strong> Borders, shadow offsets, easing curves,
            keyframes and motion tokens live in CSS. A change to a token changes both frameworks in the
            same release, because it is literally the same file content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Theming is CSS custom properties.</strong> One palette drives both apps. No
            JavaScript theme object to keep in sync.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Behaviour comes from maintained primitives.</strong> Radix on React, Reka on Vue —
            two libraries that already agree closely on ARIA patterns and keyboard behaviour, so
            interaction semantics match without hand-porting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Both registries are generated in one build</strong> from one source tree, so
            neither can quietly fall behind.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <Callout title="The part that is not shared" tone="#B084FF">
          The component source itself. A <code>.tsx</code> file and a <code>.vue</code> file are
          genuinely different programs — pretending otherwise produces a library that feels wrong in
          both frameworks. Two implementations, one visual and behavioural contract.

          Deliberate divergences. Each follows the idiom a developer in that ecosystem would expect:

        <DataGrid
          headers={['Concern', 'React', 'Vue 3']}
          rows={[
            ['Primitives', 'Radix UI', 'Reka UI'],
            ['Controlled state', 'value + onValueChange', 'v-model'],

        <p>
          Charts are the widest gap, because the engines differ. A shared authoring layer covers
          annotations, the export toolbar and loading states, so common work is portable — but deep
          customisation still means writing engine-specific options. That limit is real and worth
          knowing before you plan around it.

      <Section id="maintained" title="How parity is enforced">
        <p>
          Intent is not enough — parity decays unless something checks it. What runs on every change:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-1 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>A sync step</strong> copies source into the registry mirror, and fails the build if a mirror has drifted.</li>
          <li><strong>An import audit</strong> checks every registry item ships the files its imports need, per framework, so nothing installs broken.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility tests</strong> run automated axe passes on both React and Vue, published as a per-component matrix.</li>
          <li><strong>A contrast audit</strong> checks every semantic token pair in light and dark against WCAG, and gates the build.</li>
          <li><strong>Test suites on both sides</strong> — 610 React and 66 Vue at the time of writing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These exist because parity broke before. Every one of those checks was added after a real bug
          shipped — a Vue registry that installed a stylesheet it did not include, a component exported
          on one side and not the other, a fix applied to source but never mirrored.
        </p>

      <Section id="when" title="When this matters">
        <p><strong>Worth it when:</strong></p>
        <ul className="ml-1 space-y-2">
          <li>You genuinely ship both frameworks and want one visual language across them.</li>
          <li>You are migrating between frameworks and want the UI to stay constant while the app moves.</li>
          <li>You are choosing a library now and want the option later without a rewrite.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Not worth it when:</strong></p>
        <ul className="ml-1 space-y-2">
          <li>You are React-only and will stay that way — pick the best React option and ignore this axis entirely.</li>
          <li>You need the deepest possible framework integration, where Nuxt UI or a React-native-to-the-metal library wins.</li>
          <li>You want a neutral base to brand heavily — BoldKit&rsquo;s look is opinionated by design.</li>
