        <p>
          &ldquo;Alternative to shadcn&rdquo; is three different questions wearing one coat. Sort
          yourself into a row before reading further:
        </p>
        <Callout title="Pick your actual problem" tone="#4ECDC4">
          <ul className="ml-1 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>&ldquo;I like the model, I want a different look.&rdquo;</strong> Stay on the
              shadcn CLI and point it at a different registry. Nothing else changes — same install
              command, same code ownership.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to own the code.&rdquo;</strong> You want a real
              dependency you upgrade with a version bump: daisyUI, Flowbite, Element Plus, MUI.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>&ldquo;I want to style everything myself.&rdquo;</strong> Drop a layer down to
              headless primitives — Radix UI on React, Reka UI on Vue. shadcn/ui is a styled wrapper
              around Radix, so this is removing an opinion, not replacing one.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </Callout>
        <p>
          The mistake is treating these as interchangeable. Swapping shadcn/ui for daisyUI is not a
          restyle — it is a change in who owns the component code and how you upgrade it.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section id="what-you-keep" title="What you keep either way">
        <p>
          If you stay inside the shadcn ecosystem and only change registry, these stay identical, which
          is why switching costs so little:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-1 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>The CLI</strong> — <code>npx shadcn@latest add &lt;url&gt;</code> for React, <code>npx shadcn-vue@latest add &lt;url&gt;</code> for Vue.</li>
          <li><strong>Code ownership</strong> — files land in <code>components/ui/</code> and become yours to edit.</li>
          <li><strong>The primitive layer</strong> — most registries build on Radix (React) or Reka (Vue), so accessibility behaviour and keyboard handling carry over.</li>
          <li><strong>Tailwind</strong> — theming stays CSS-variable driven, so your existing tokens usually survive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          What changes is the visual language and the breadth of the catalogue. That is genuinely all
          — which is why &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; inside the registry world is a much smaller decision
          than it sounds.

          Several sites in this space advertise 400–800+ &ldquo;blocks&rdquo;. Those numbers usually
          count every variant of every section separately, and a large share sit behind a paid tier.
          Compare what is actually free and actually installable before treating a headline number as
          a feature.

        <p>
          shadcn/ui is deliberately neutral. That is the point — it is a starting surface you are
          expected to brand. The cost is that a default shadcn app looks like every other default
          shadcn app, which is the single most common reason people go looking for alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>Two ways out:</p>
        <ul className="ml-1 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Theme it yourself.</strong> Change the CSS variables, radius and fonts. Cheapest
            option, and usually enough for a product that wants to look conventional but not generic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Start from a registry that already has a point of view.</strong> You inherit an
            aesthetic instead of authoring one — useful when the alternative is shipping the default
            palette forever because nobody had time to design.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          BoldKit is the second kind: every component is neubrutalist by construction — 3px borders,
          hard offset shadows with zero blur, no border radius, uppercase tracked labels. That is a
          strong commitment, and the honest caveat is that it is not a neutral base. If you need
          something quiet and corporate, theme shadcn/ui instead.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section id="vue" title="If you are on Vue or Nuxt">
        <p>
          This is where the alternatives list thins out sharply. shadcn/ui itself is React-only, and a
          React registry cannot install into a Vue project — the files are <code>.tsx</code>, the
          primitives are Radix, and neither ports across.
        </p>
        <p>Practical options today:</p>
        <ul className="ml-1 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>shadcn-vue</strong> — the community port. Mirrors the shadcn API on Reka UI, with its own CLI and registry format.</li>
          <li><strong>Nuxt UI</strong> — if you are on Nuxt specifically and happy with a dependency, this is the most integrated choice.</li>
          <li><strong>Element Plus / PrimeVue</strong> — mature, broad, styled. Closer to MUI than to shadcn in philosophy.</li>
          <li><strong>BoldKit</strong> — ships a parallel Vue registry so the same components exist in both frameworks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The gap worth knowing about: most of the popular block and template libraries in the shadcn
          orbit are React-only. If you are on Vue, a large part of the ecosystem you read about
          simply is not available to you.

      <Section id="boldkit" title="Where BoldKit fits">
        <p>
          BoldKit is a shadcn-compatible registry with a fixed aesthetic, published for React and Vue
          from one source. Concretely:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-1 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>{COUNTS.components}+ components</strong>, <strong>{COUNTS.charts} chart types</strong>, <strong>{COUNTS.shapes} SVG shapes</strong>, <strong>{COUNTS.blocks} blocks</strong> and <strong>{COUNTS.templates} templates</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>React and Vue parity</strong> — the same component, same props where the frameworks allow, installed through each framework&rsquo;s own CLI.</li>
          <li><strong>MIT, no pro tier</strong> — nothing in the catalogue is paywalled.</li>
          <li><strong>Charts in both frameworks</strong> — Recharts on React, ECharts on Vue, behind one API.</li>
        </ul>
        <Callout title="What it is not" tone="#FF6B35">
          <ul className="ml-1 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Not neutral.</strong> The neubrutalist look is the product. Toning it down means overriding a lot.</li>
            <li><strong>Not a blocks marketplace.</strong> {COUNTS.blocks} blocks and {COUNTS.templates} templates, and they are copy-paste from the docs rather than CLI-installable.</li>
            <li><strong>Not a drop-in shadcn replacement.</strong> Component names overlap, but the styling is opinionated enough that swapping mid-project is a visual redesign.</li>
          </ul>
        </Callout>
      </Section>

      <Section id="choosing" title="How to choose">
        <p>Three questions, in order. They resolve most of the decision:</p>
        <ol className="ml-4 list-decimal space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Do you want to own the component code?</strong> Yes → a registry (shadcn/ui,
            shadcn-vue, BoldKit). No → a dependency (daisyUI, Flowbite, MUI, Element Plus).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do you have a designer?</strong> Yes → start neutral and brand it. No → start from
            a registry with an opinion, so the default state already looks deliberate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Which frameworks must this serve?</strong> React only → the whole field is open.
            Vue or both → the field narrows to shadcn-vue, Nuxt UI, the styled Vue libraries, and
            BoldKit.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you land on &ldquo;registry, opinionated, both frameworks&rdquo;, that is the specific
          corner BoldKit was built for. If you land anywhere else, one of the options above will serve
          you better — the list is here so you can find it.
